ISMT ANCHOR
Targeted Audiences: ISMT Students
Solution:
In this world of information, we have information all around us but struggling to identify which ones are accurate and effective. A major challenge we face daily is finding the right academic materials. So, ISMT ANCHOR is a platform that allows both students and teachers to upload and access a wide range of academic content, such as notes, career roadmaps from ISMT graduates, and instructional videos, all available for free. Another objective of this software is to provide information to students related to fees. ISMT ANCHOR provides students with detailed information on due bills, fines for attendance, and deadlines for payments. The software also sends timely notifications and reminders, aiding both the administration and students in efficiently managing their financial responsibilities.  So, the software will provide information related to due bills, fine from attendance and valid time to pay the fee, also providing notifications as a reminder to pay the bill.
